This repository contains a simple Swift program that demonstrates a common type mismatch error. The program defines a function that calculates the area of a rectangle, and then calls the function with arguments of the wrong type. This results in a compile-time error. The solution shows how to fix the error by ensuring that the arguments passed to the function are of the correct type.
